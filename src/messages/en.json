        "a2": "Forget generic templates. We design every interface from scratch for your brand, ensuring your business stands out with an exclusive, modern, and impossible-to-ignore design.",
        "q3": "How do you ensure the site doesn't 'lag' or take forever to open on mobile?",

        "q4": "I've had bad experiences with slow sites. What makes yours different?",

        "a5": "We don't just do 'the basics'. We perform keyword research, optimize metadata, ensure immediate indexing, and configure Rich Results so your site appears with maximum prominence in searches.",
